# AI-Powered Code Helper

## Brief Description
An intelligent tool to assist programmers with code suggestions based on natural language input.

## Technologies Used
- Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar)
- Programming language of your choice
- Potentially a framework for creating a simple user interface

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run the project.

## Usage Instructions
Users can input coding problems or tasks in natural language and receive relevant code snippets or API calls as suggestions.

## Challenges
Understanding natural language and generating code snippets based on user input can be complex.

## Example User Inputs
- "How do I sort a list of numbers in Python?"
- "I need a function to reverse a string"
- "Show me how to fetch weather data for a given city using an API"

## Skills Developed
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
- Working with large language models
- API integration
- Developing creative AI-powered solutions

## Stretch Goals
- Multiple Language Support
- Code Explanation
- Context Awareness

**Disclaimer:** This project is ambitious and requires overcoming challenges in understanding natural language and programming constructs.
